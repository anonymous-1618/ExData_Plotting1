# Course-Project
Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project Assigment

***************************************************
###This project has ten files with the relevant informations:

1.	My_Assignment_README.md (Present file)
2.	README.md (Description of the Project Assigment, Original file) 
3.	4 (four) R codes to build the Require Plots (plot1.R, plot2.R, ...)
4.	4 (four) PNG Plot files (plot1.png, plot2.png, ...)

###The developed scripts are able to:

1.	Download and Unzip a compressed data from a provided URL.
2.	Load to R Global environment the datafile.
3.	Clean the data by assigning the correct class and removing any undesirable data
4.	Select the data in the request time period.
5.	Build the plot and save it PNG file with a size 480 x 480 pixels.


###Remarks:

*  This work should be read in conjunction with the original README file of the Project Assignment.

*  The assigning of variables class (other than Data and Time) as numeric, "NA"s are introduced by coercion because of "?".

*  Because it is requested to include the code for reading data, each one of the four R plot scripts has this task in common, that is, Lines 1-37 in all four R codes are the same.

*  IT IS NOT REQUESTED to run the code, but if you do so, please note that it may take time both to download and clean the data to make it ready to build the plots. Because Lines 1-37 in all the codes are common - after running a full code for the first time, you may want to shorten the overall time for the other three remaining codes by just running the parts of the code that actually build and save the plot.
